🚀 My DevOps Journey: Week 1 – Introduction to DevOps & Basic Linux Commands
As part of my weekly learning habit, I’m sharing what I’ve learned in my first week of DevOps. This post covers my early understanding of DevOps, its role in the software development lifecycle (SDLC), where different DevOps tools are used, and a list of basic Linux commands I’ve practiced so far.

💡 What is DevOps?
DevOps is a cultural and technical practice that brings development and operations teams together to deliver software faster, more reliably, and with better collaboration.

🔄 Role of DevOps in the SDLC
DevOps plays a key role throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Plan – Developers and operations teams collaborate from the start.

Develop – Code is written and version controlled.

Build & Test – Code is automatically built and tested.

Release – New versions are released using automated pipelines.

Deploy – Applications are deployed across environments.

Operate & Monitor – Applications are monitored for performance and errors.

DevOps promotes continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), ensuring code is always ready for deployment with minimal manual intervention.

🛠️ Tools & Their Purpose in DevOps
I also learned about which tools are used where in the DevOps lifecycle:

For Server Automation:
Tools like Ansible and Terraform are used to automate server provisioning and infrastructure setup.

For Deployment & Containerization:
Tools like Docker and Kubernetes help package and deploy applications in containers, making them easy to run on any environment.

For CI/CD Pipelines:
Tools like Git, Jenkins, and others are used to build pipelines for continuous integration and delivery.

I’ll start learning these tools in detail in the coming weeks.

🐧 Linux Basics – My First Step into the Terminal
Since Linux is a foundational part of DevOps, I started learning Linux commands this week. Due to some delay in setting up Ubuntu, I couldn’t go very deep, but I still covered a lot of useful commands.

🔧 Linux Commands I Practiced
Command	Description
cd	Change directory
ls	List files/directories
mkdir	Make new directories
touch	Create new empty files
cp	Copy files/directories
wc	Count words, lines, characters
cat	Display file content
zcat	Display compressed file content
head	Show the first lines of a file
tail	Show the last lines of a file
less	View file content one screen at a time
more	Similar to less, but older
tee	Read from input and write to a file and terminal
clear	Clear the terminal
diff	Compare the contents of two files
echo	Display text or variables
soft link	Symbolic link to a file
hard link	Direct link to the file data

📚 Resources I Followed
I followed two amazing YouTube channels to help guide my learning:

Linux from Train With Shubham
A great beginner-friendly playlist to learn Linux commands.

DevOps Concepts from Abhishek Veeramalla
I watched two detailed videos this week that explained what DevOps is and how it fits into real-world projects.

📅 What's Next?
In Week 2, I plan to:

Deepen my Linux command knowledge

Learn how Git and version control work in DevOps

Explore more DevOps concepts like CI/CD and deployment basics
